# sketchi-front
Openfront but different. No idea why I made this though

ENTIRELY BROKEN
Nothing as of now

Made using AI, as shown by the GEMINI.md file that my collaborator apparently forgot to remove before committing to the main branch.

Maybe if he didn't use AI all the time, this would work better, as we would be able to understand the code more easily.
